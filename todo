* combine plots
* wider domain
* error bars
* aggregate functions
	- y = a*max_size+ (1 - a)*num_components
	- Normalize each term : divide by maximum
	- a is weight parameter
	- weighting of choices to show optimizations
	- plot range of a's to s
* minimize shortest path and lowest cost (least wire length)
	- Example:  N = 1000 nodes  largest graph while minimizing
* distribution
	- try gaussian
	- 
* Get it woring for 10k wires
* Try finding an optimum parameter set for a particular distribution
	- i.e what a and b for a Guassian will minimize cost and
